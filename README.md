## What is This?

This is a set of knowledge base files (aka prompts) that helps Claude Code understand our development preferences, coding standards, and project-specific practices. Instead of repeating instructions in every session, we have created a set of reference documents that Claude reads as needed.

Think of it as teaching Claude how we want to work — philosophy, rhythm, patterns.

## Start every new claude session with the following:
Please read index.md

## Core Files (Read at Session Start)

- **[index.md](index.md)** - Start here! Navigation and usage guide
- **[style-guide.md](style-guide.md)** - Coding standards and Unit Testing conventions
- **[working-agreement.md](working-agreement.md)** - Partnership charter
